Sales Forecasting Project Report
Subtask 1: Prepare Time Series Data
The dataset was first prepared for time series analysis.

The order date column was converted into datetime format and used to extract useful features like year, month, and day.

Sales values were aggregated by daily/weekly/monthly intervals to ensure consistency.

Missing or incomplete records were identified and handled either by filling gaps with 0 or imputing values where necessary.

Data was then analyzed to check for trends, seasonality, and anomalies (e.g., festive sales spikes).

Finally, the dataset was chronologically sorted, indexed by date, and saved in CSV format for further forecasting.

✅ Output: A clean, structured, and time-indexed dataset ready for forecasting.

Subtask 2: Choose and Apply a Forecasting Model
Several forecasting techniques were reviewed (Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM).

Based on the characteristics of the dataset (trend + seasonality), the most suitable model was applied.

The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

The chosen forecasting model was trained on historical sales and evaluated using performance metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

✅ Output: A trained forecasting model capable of predicting future sales.

Subtask 3: Predict Future Sales
The trained model was used to predict sales for the next 6–12 months.

Forecasted values were compared with actual sales in the test data.

Visualizations were created (line charts of actual vs. predicted sales, bar/heatmaps for seasonal peaks).

Insights showed seasonal patterns, peak sales during festive months, and potential slow periods.

Business implications were analyzed, such as inventory planning and targeted marketing strategies.

✅ Output: Forecasted sales dataset + visual insights for decision-making.

Subtask 4: Final Submission Deliverables
The final project includes:

Sales Forecasting Report (this document) summarizing methodology and insights.

Visualizations: Line chart (historical vs. predicted), seasonal sales bar chart/heatmap.

Forecast Dataset (CSV) with next 6–12 months sales predictions.

Model Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAPE values to validate model performance.

Business Recommendations: Inventory optimization, promotion planning, and resource allocation based on forecasted trends.

✅ Output: A complete forecasting solution with actionable insights.

✨ Conclusion
This project successfully prepared the dataset, applied a suitable forecasting model, and predicted future sales. The analysis highlights key sales patterns, provides accuracy metrics, and supports business decision-making for improved revenue planning.
